        <p>While we were staying in Florence we decided to make a day trip the island of Venice. Robyn had not been there before so it was 
            definitely a must do for us. We trained into the station there and upon exiting was immediately greeted with quintissential Venice:
            waterways, cobblestone streets, and boats! We had a great time there traversing the many streets seeing the tourist sights. It was about
            90 degrees and humid so definitely not the most comfortable experience but it was fantastic nonetheless to see one of the most picturesque
            cities the world has to offer...
